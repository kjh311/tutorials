<h1>Test Driven Development</h1>

<h3>What is Test-Driven Development (TDD)?</h3>

<h3>
Test-driven development starts with developing test for each one of the features. The test might fail as the tests are developed even before the development. Development team then develops and refactors the code to pass the test.

Test-driven development is related to the test-first programming evolved as part of extreme programming concepts.</h3>

<h3>Test-Driven Development Process:</h3>

<h3>Add a Test

Run all tests and see if the new one fails

Write some code

Run tests and Refactor code

Repeat

Code Based Testing
Context of Testing:
Valid inputs

Invalid inputs

Errors, exceptions, and events

Boundary conditions

Everything that might break</h3>

<h3>Benefits of TDD:</h3>
<h3>Much less debug time

Code proven to meet requirements

Tests become Safety Net

Near zero defects

Shorter development cycles</h3>
